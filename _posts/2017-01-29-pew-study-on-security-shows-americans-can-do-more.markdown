  Pew Study Reveals Gaps In Americans' Password Practices

The Pew Research Center has released a report showing that many Americans still do not use cybersecurity best practices in their own daily lives despite widespread distrust in online services' ability to protect their data.

The study found that consumers' distrust of the Internet is well founded, as 64 percent of the respondents suffered from data theft. 

* 41 percent have found fraudulent charges on their credit cards
* 35 percent have received notices that their sensitive data had been exposed
* 16 percent reported losing control of their email accounts
* 15 percent received notices that their Social Security Number was compromised
* 14 percent said someone attempted to open lines of credit in their name
* 13 percent have had someone hijack their social media accounts
* 6 percent claimed that someone stole their identity to commit tax fraud

The impacts of these breaches can range from frustrating to painful, and are often out of consumers' direct control. There are things you can do to limit the impact of these incidents, but there are still risks inherent with trusting your data with anyone on the Internet.

It's not surprising then, when about half of the respondents said they felt like their data was less secure than it was five years ago. Unfortunately, this skepticism doesn't necessarily translate to people taking measures to safeguard their own data.

Nearly half of the respondents said they write down their passwords on pieces of paper, for example. They reported several other bad password practices as well, including sharing their passwords with other people (41 percent), using the same password for multiple sites (39 percent), or using insecure passwords because they're easier to memorize (25 percent).

In addition to poor password practices, the Pew study identified several other inherently insecure practices among respondents such as failing to update software in a timely manner, and using insecure public Wi-Fi to perform sensitive actions such as online banking or purchases. This all adds up to a lot of unnecessary risk.

Yes, it's true; you can't fully trust other people to take care of your data. But, that's all the more reason to take every precaution you can to keep your data safe. 

Just looking at password practices, there are a few things that you can start doing today to make yourself safer.

These practices will mitigate your risk when the inevitable happens and someone manages to hack one of the sites you use and steal everyone's login information. The two essential things to do are to use long, complex passwords, and never use the same password for two different sites. After these two things, I also highly recommend you use two-factor authentication wherever possible. (More on how to do this later!)

A quick note on length and complexity for your passwords: Length is the most important factor in password strength, and I recommend keeping your passwords at least 15 characters long. In order to make your password complex, you need to include upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters (like @#$%^), and they need to be spread out in the password, not clumped together.

The risk created by reusing passwords isn't just hypothetical, either.

There's an emerging attack trend that security researchers call "credential stuffing," that hackers are using to gain access to people's accounts. It basically works like this: Hackers manage to steal usernames and passwords from Site A, and then start trying all of those username/password combinations on Site B. There is a good chance that any users who used Site A and Site B, and used the same password for both sites, will have their account on Site B compromised. Meanwhile, users who used different passwords for both sites will likely be protected from this type of attack.

You may be thinking now, "But there's no way I can memorize a different 15-character password for every site I visit!"

Don't worry. You don't have to! There are many products available that will do all the memorization for you. They are called password managers, and they are indispensable for proper password security.

There are several options for password managers. I use [https://1password.com/](https://1password.com/), but for more choices check out [PC Magazine's Roundup of the best offerings for 2017](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407168,00.asp)). Whichever one you choose, they all offer the same core function: to securely store and organize your passwords so that you don't have to keep them all memorized. Most will even generate strong, random passwords for you, and auto-fill login forms on your Web browser, so you can access your sites with the click of a button. Simply using a password manager will make following my two essential password rules a no-brainer.

It is a little disheartening that so many people on the Internet do not take their security as seriously as they could, but the bright side is that we can learn from this and take inspiration to be responsible for our own security. I hope you have already been using good password practices, but if not, there's no better time to start than today!
