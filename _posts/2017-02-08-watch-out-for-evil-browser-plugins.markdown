  How to spot and remove browser-hijacking programs

  They may seem innocuous, but these programs take away some of your control over your own computer while offering little to no value in return.

Malwarebytes published an [interesting writeup](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/puppum/2017/02/spigot-browser-hijackers/) this week about several variants of the Spigot browser hijacker. These programs have a lot of easy-to-spot things in common, including their method of installation and their behaviors once installed. 

In case you were wondering, browser hijackers are programs that take control of your Web browser and doing things like change your start page, change your default new tab page, change your default search provider, and add bookmarks to your browser. (The start page is the default Web site your browser goes to when you first open it. Similarly, the new tab page is the default site your browser visits when you open a new tab.) They may seem innocuous, but these programs take away some of your control over your own computer while offering little to no value in return. And, there is a chance the links and bookmarks they place in your browser could lead to sites that further compromise your computer.

So, what are the halmarks of one of these Spigot plugins?

First, let's look at the affected browsers. Not all browsers are equal, and some are more vulnerable to exploitation than others. The Spigot plugins generally target Internet Explorer, and some variants work on Firefox and Chrome. According to Malwarebytes' analysis, though, Microsoft's new Edge browser (the one that comes packaged with Windows 10), is not yet susceptible to these programs.

Another thing you can look for is some specific language in the End User License Agreement (EULA) on the program's download page. That's the long piece of legalese that you have to accept before installing a program, but that most people don't read. Malwarebytes' researchers noted that the EULAs for most of the Spigot plugins contained language matching or similar to:

>*The Software is a free desktop application that offers you direct links to websites from your new preferred homepage and saves your new preferred home page and/or new tab page. When we set your Browser’s settings using the Software, they will be saved automatically on Chrome™, Firefox®, and Internet Explorer®. As part of the installation process of the Software, we may change your Internet Browser settings and/or provide you with the ability to opt to make changes to your Internet Browser settings.*

Further signs that you are about to install one of these unwanted plugins can be found in the download location for the installation file. They usually come from roinstall-download[dot]com or report-download[dot]com, so be on the lookout for those domains and avoid them.

Finally, you can tell when you have installed one of these plugins by the new start page it adds to your browser. This will generally be a search page with a slew of links to various sites, weather data, and links to social media sites. If you open your browser one day to find the start page is not what you remember, or it's cluttered with a bunch of stuff you didn't put there, then you may have accidentally installed a Spigot browser hijacker.

There is hope, though! Malwarebytes has instructions on their forums on how to uninstall several of these plugins, including:

The Spigot family of plugins are just a small part of a larger family of programs that researchers call Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs). PUPs are programs that aren't strictly malicious by nature, as in, they aren't stealing your bank account information or turning your computer into a botnet zombie, but that are of questionable value to the user. These can go by many names, such as Spyware, Crapware, Adware, etc. The common theme, though, is that these programs generally don't provide any benefit to you while enriching their developers and bogging down your computer. A great example is the Ask Toolbar, which is one of the more notorious PUPs. 

The best solution is prevention. Simply don't install anything you aren't 100 percent sure you want on your computer. If you're considering installing some new software, do plenty of research to see whether its a trustworthy program. 

A site I sometimes use is [shouldiremoveit.com](http://www.shouldiremoveit.com/programs.aspx?q=ask.com). It will give you quite a bit of crowd-sourced information on most programs, sometimes even including how to uninstall them. It's a pretty good quick way to see if other people have had problems with a particular program. As a caveat, Should I Remove It? also has a utility you can download and install to help identify unwanted software on your computer. I have not used it, and do not recommend you install it. Their site alone should provide you enough information to make a decision before you install something (or help you identify something to remove from your computer). 

If you do find yourself with unwanted programs bloating your machine, there are plenty of tutorials online on how to remove them. 

Most are along the lines of this Lifewire.com article, [How To Remove Unwanted Programs from Your Windows PC](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-uninstaller-to-remove-unused-programs-3506955). Following those steps should solve most of your PUP problems. 

For more stubborn pieces of Crapware, Tech Radar has a comprehensive tutorial: [10 Tips For Removing A Program That Won't Uninstall](http://www.techradar.com/news/software/10-tips-for-removing-a-program-that-won-t-uninstall-907471). It is a little more technical than the average user might find helpful, but following these steps will likely help you get rid of difficult to remove software. 

In summary, be on the watch out for unwanted browser plugins and programs, and always practice safe Web browsing!
