  ## Friggin' Security
  A security blog for the people

Friggin' Security is a blog that highlights cyber threat trends and discusses what the average person can do to fortify their home networks and devices. My goal is to write these blog posts in a way that is informative, but easy enough to understand that my readers can use this information to protect themselves from digital threats regardless of their technical skill level.
